# plan-out-social-media-
plan out social media posts through a grid structure for photo-based apps, or add more media types, including video, text, photos, etc, might be later integrated into an iOS or android application
        
   languages used: javascript, html, css
   
   
        
        Features
 * a simple yet effective interface to add photos, move them into different grid structures, or add text in the description box
 * using the official social media APIs to analyze activity on your posts, making automatic charts based on how much             activity you received for each post, etc
 * offering up the same set of hashtags you used in the past to make it easier for you to write up your posts
* despite not being able to automatically post for you, it's still helpful for influencers to use this since i know they like being able to see their latest activities since they tend to work hard for each post they make, and more data analytics for their activties on all social media they use for their influencer job will enable them to reach a broader audience range
